# FloodAI
FloodAI: A machine learning-based system for accurate flood prediction. This repository provides code, datasets, and documentation to develop and deploy an intelligent flood prediction model. Empowering communities with timely information for enhanced flood preparedness and response.

# Machine Learning Project
This is a machine learning project that focuses on classification using logistic regression. The project utilizes several Python libraries, including numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn (sklearn). The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify data based on a given set of features.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn (sklearn)
You can install these libraries using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the libraries from the above commands.
2. Place the code and datasets in the same folder.
3. Now simply run the python file to get prediction of flood of current from past year data.

# Conclusion
This machine learning project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for flood prediction. It provides a template for loading and preprocessing a dataset, feature scaling, and feature extraction using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. The logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric.

Happy machine learning!
